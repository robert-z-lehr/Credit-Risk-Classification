    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We'll work with a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before You Begin\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new repository for this project called `credit-risk-classification`. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the new repository to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside your `credit-risk-classification` repository, create a folder titled `Credit_Risk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the `Credit_Risk` folder, add the `credit_risk_classification.ipynb` and `lending_data.csv` files found in the `Starter_Code.zip` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Push your changes to GitHub.\n",
